# Password Saver Application

## Overview
This is a password saver application built using static HTML and script.js for frontend functionalities. Firebase is utilized for backend services. It provides features such as updating, deleting, generating passwords, and copying passwords securely. The application employs robust security rules to ensure data safety.

## How to Run
To run this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pranjalhtpydev/PASAVER.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd password-saver
   ```

3. Replace the Firebase configuration with your own:
   - Open the `script.js` file.
   - Replace the Firebase configuration object with your own Firebase project configuration. You can find this configuration in your Firebase project settings.

4. Serve the application:
   You can use any static file server to serve the HTML file and JavaScript. For example, you can use Node.js's `http-server` package:
   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   http-server .
   ```
